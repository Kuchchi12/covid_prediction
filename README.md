# covid_prediction
Used distributions like Weibull, Gaussian, Log-Normal to identify the best fit model over covid dataset
Used Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm for identifying parameters to gain best possible curve fitting
Examined the credibility of the model using three different metrics like MAE, MSE and R2-Score

Coronavirus or COVID 19 does not require much introduction as it has impacted our
lives very badly. However, let us have some quick looks which will help us to understand
this situation better. On December 31, 2019, China reported WHO about unusual
pneumonia cases being witnessed in the city of Wuhan. It was the very beginning of
COVID-19. Since then, the cumulative incidence of the causative virus (SARS-CoV-2) is
rapidly increasing and has affected around 220 countries, with a death of 2.5 million
people and still counting. These viruses can cause respiratory symptoms in humans,
along with other symptoms of common cold and fever. There are no specific treatments
for coronaviruses to date. However, one can avoid infection by maintaining basic
personal hygiene and social distancing from infected persons. India had also made it to
the list of victims of this virus. The first case was reported at the end of January 2019.Around 11 million cases have been reported in India till now, with 157K deaths. Besides
peopleâ€™s health, the coronavirus outbreak has also affected the economy of the country.
One such outcome is depicted in the price hike of vehicle diving fuels as COVID-19 has
affected imports and exports of the country. Also, the lockdown loss needs to be
compensated. The online study was sought as one of the major revolutions of the 21st
century. However, no one had expected it to come in handy in such a situation. Students
have been away from their educational institutions for more than a year now.
After following an exponential growth, fortunately, cases in India are decreasing now.
The exact reason behind it is hard to predict. Scientists are giving credit to the proper
execution of rules and preventive measures, warm climatic conditions, pre-covid
preparations. Also, the distribution of vaccines has played its part. Still, we cannot
expect the conditions to become normal again. States like Maharashtra are again
witnessing the increase in cases. Since the beginning of February, Amravati has
recorded more than 10,000 cases and over 66 deaths from Covid. More than 1,000 were
receiving treatment for the disease this week. The positivity rate is in frightful double
digits. Amravati and a few other districts in Maharashtra have been again locked down.
However, states like Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh have recorded relatively fewer
cases. As of February 23, there were 220 active cases in the state of Himachal
Pradesh.
The world requires efficient methodologies and research to confront this chaotic
situation. Deep learning presents itself as one such tool today. For example, ML and AI
are used to augment the diagnosis and screening process of the identified patient with
radio imaging technology. The list of such examples is endless. Wrapping covid datasets
with Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), researchers can forecast
where and when the disease is likely to spread and notify those regions to match the
required arrangements. Our group makes a small endeavour in similar regard. We are
trying to analyse and predict the pandemic situation in different states of India. We are
using Machine learning algorithms like Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) for curve fitting. We
will be trying and testing various distributions and try to present the best fit in different
scenarios.
